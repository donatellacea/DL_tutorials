    "- create the dataset for the training of a model that can recognize objects or people\n",
    "- understand the limitations and pitfalls of DL\n",
    "- think and discuss about posssible interesting applications of classification with Teachable Machine."

You can also move the mouse on the question mark next to the different functions to read a short explanation.\n",

    "*Epochs*: the number of iterations over the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Under the hood*: you can also visualize the main graph to understand how the model is performing by clicking on the 'Under the hood' menu. In particular, you can focus on the **learning curve** that represents how the model is learning, plotting the loss as a function of the epoch. If the model is actually learning the losses, of both the training and the test set (see next section), should decrease over the epochs. To see how this learning curve evolves during the training, leave the 'under the hood' window open. If the model is learning correctly, you will aww that at the beginning the losses have a higher value, and then start to decrease. Another interesting plot that the model automatically creates is the **confusion matrix** that allows us to see the ratio of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.\n",

    "**Preview**: You can test your model on a new image that you can upload or see through the camera. You will see that the model will try to identify the label of the new object showing a different percentage in the colored bars under the image. The bars represent the confidence the model has in predicting different categories."
