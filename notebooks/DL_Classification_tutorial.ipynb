    "With the term **Machine Learning** (ML) we define a set of algorithms and methods that provide a machine with the ability to learn automatically and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "When we have labeled data, we can use the label to guide the learning process, and this is called **Supervised learning**. If data are not labeled, it means that we don't have a guide or a supervision, and this is called **Unsupervised learning**.\n",
    "Within Supervised learning we can have two different kind if problems:\n",
    " - **Regression problem**: the task of predicting a contineous quantity,  \n",
    " - **Classification problem**: the task of predicting a label or a class (discrete values).\n",

Only with proper training is it possible to interpret the scans, so without a radiology/medical background, it is tough to understand the presence of Covid-19 from the scan. But we will see that a well-trained NN can help the technicians and doctors diagnose this kind of disease."
