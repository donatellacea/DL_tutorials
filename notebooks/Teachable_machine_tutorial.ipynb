    "- create the data sets for the training of a model that can recognize objects or people\n",
    "- understand the limitations and pitfalls of DL\n",
    "- think and discuss about posssible interesting applications of classification with Teachable Machine."

    "There is three main sections on the page, you can read an overview of the available functionalities. Feel free to skip this part and go directly to the task and come back in case you have any doubts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: On the lefthand side of the page, you can edit the classes, choosing a label for each class you want the model to learn, then you can simply add the images and create your own dataset. You could both upload the image from your computer, and create the dataset using the webcam.\n",
    "Click on the webcam button and you will see a window that accesses your camera and where you can eventually decide to crop or flip the image.\n",
    "In order to start collecting the images hold on the blue button below the camera window, or open the menu and choose to record a few seconds without holding the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**: Once your dataset is ready you can start the training, by clicking on Train Model. There is the opportunity to customize the training, choosing some hyperparameters. To do that open the Advanced menu.\n",
    "Here you can select:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Epochs*: the number of iterations over the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Batch Size*: the number of samples processed before the model is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Learning Rate*: how fast we want the network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Under the hood*: you can also visualize the main graph to understand how the model is performing by clicking on the 'Under the hood' menu. In particular, you can focus on the **learning curve** that represents how the model is learning, plotting the loss as a function of the epoch. If the model is actually learning the losses, of both the training and the test set, should decrease over the epochs. To see how this learning curve evolves during the training, leave the 'under the hood' window open, you will see that at the beginning the losses have a higher value, and then start to decrease. Another interesting plot that the model automatically creates is the **confusion matrix** that allows us to see the ratio of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preview**: You can test your model on a new image that you can upload or see through the camera. You will see that the model will try to identify the label of the new object showing a different percentage in the colored bars under the image. The bars represent the confidence the model in predicting different categories."

    "No matter if we are dealing with classification or regression problems, a crucial aspect of determining if the results are meaningful or not is the evaluation of the performance of our model. \n",

    "\n",
    "It is essential to point out that the evaluation must be made on data that are not visible to the network during the training. In other words, the objective is to estimate the machine learning model's performance on new data not used to train the model, i.e. the test data."
