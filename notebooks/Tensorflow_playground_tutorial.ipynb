    "### Parameters & Setting\n",
    "In this section, we will briefly explain the meaning of the parameters that you could possibly change. \n",
    "We will define all of them, but only a few will be useful for the purpose of this tutorial and the accomplishment of the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epochs**: \n",
    "number of iterations over the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning rate**: how fast we want the network to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation function**: function that computes the output of a neuron (it transforms the weighted sum of the input into an output).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization & Regularization rate**: method to prevent overfitting (i.e. the model doesn't generalize well to new data). It is not necessary for simple problems where overfitting is not happening. In this tutorial, we will set them respectively to None and 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Type**: set to classification if you want to predict whether a data point belongs to a certain class: set to regression if the goal is to predict a continuous value. In this tutorial, we are only performing classification, notice that here we are dealing with binary classification, but ANN is also able to perform multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: these represent the input of the ANN.\n",
    "- kind of dataset that can be chosen, clicking on the different squared buttons\n",
    "- you can also choose the ratio of data used for training or testing. Usually, we set the training set size to 80% and the test set to 20%. In this tutorial, we will leave it to 50%\n",
    "- Noise: some noise can be added to data to make it harder to find the solution, we will keep it to zero, but you can try later to introduce some noise and repeat the task to observe the difference.\n",
    "- Batch size: number of samples processed before the model is updated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**: \n",
    "these represent the properties of each data point. In this case, we will work with two features $x_1$ and $x_2$, that represent respectively the horizontal and the vertical position. The other ones represent a different combination of the first two and are used to achieve better performances throughout the process so-called *feature engineering*. This might help determine some more complex relationships among the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hidden Layers and neurons**:\n",
    "A basic network is made of different layers each with a certain number of neurons. The first layer is called the input layer, the last one is the output layer and (at the level of the prediction of the network0. Only these two layers are necessary, but especially when the problem is not linear, and is more complex, we might want to add layers to the network, these intermediate layers are called hidden layers. In each layer, we can also set the number of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**: the results are visualized in the righthand box. Before performing the training the background is light blue/ gray. During the training, it starts changing colors and if the ANN is correctly learning how to predict the classes, the colored zone will cover the zone with the dots of the same color. The background color shows what the network is predicting for a particular area. The intensity of the color shows how confident that prediction is.\n",
    "The output also shows the learning curves for train and test loss function, the goal of an ANN is to minimize the loss functions, so during the training, you will see that these values are decreasing. At the beginning of the training, the loss starts from high values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to start a training**: When clicking on the top-left arrow the training starts and we can see the progression in the number of epochs, we can also slow the process down and manually increment the epoche with the smaller button. To start over, click the refresh button."
